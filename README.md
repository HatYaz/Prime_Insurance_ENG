# Prime_Insurance_ENG

This Python program is a desktop application for evaluating climate insurance premiums. It provides a user-friendly interface built with Tkinter, allowing users to:

Enter risk parameters manually (annual frequency, average severity, deductible, coinsurance).

Import historical claims from a CSV file to automatically calculate frequency and severity.

Apply technical factors such as exposure, vulnerability, and climate.

Include charges and margins (operating expenses, commercial margin, uncertainty/reinsurance).

Calculate and display the resulting premiums:

Pure premium

Technical premium

Commercial premium

Results are displayed in a formatted, readable text area. The program also includes helpful instructions and error handling for invalid inputs or CSV files.
